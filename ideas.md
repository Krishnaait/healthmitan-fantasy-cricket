  **Design Movement**: **Cyber-Tactical Glassmorphism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Transparency & Depth**: Layered glass surfaces representing depth of strategy.
  2. **Precision & Data**: Focus on statistics and analytics as the core visual language.
  3. **Immersive Focus**: Dark, moody atmosphere that highlights critical information.
  4. **Fluid Dynamics**: Smooth transitions representing the flow of the game.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Midnight Blue (#0f172a)** as the base canvas, representing the intensity of night matches.
  - **Neon Cyan (#06b6d4)** for primary actions and data highlights, symbolizing digital precision.
  - **Electric Lime (#84cc16)** for success states and positive stats, evoking the cricket field turf.
  - **Frosted White (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1))** for glass panels, creating separation without occlusion.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette moves away from the typical "bright sports" look to a more sophisticated, analytical "command center" vibe, appealing to the strategic aspect of fantasy cricket.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Dashboard**: Moving away from centered content. Navigation on the left or floating, with content panels arranged like a tactical HUD (Heads-Up Display).
  - **Modular Cards**: Content lives in floating glass cards with varying blur levels to indicate hierarchy.
  - **Z-Axis Layering**: Important elements float "closer" to the user with stronger borders and glows.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Hexagonal Data Points**: Using hexagons for player stats and skills, referencing the geometry of cricket balls and tactical grids.
  - **Glowing Pitch Map**: The cricket pitch isn't just a green rectangle; it's a glowing wireframe grid showing fielding positions and scoring zones.
  - **Frosted Glass Borders**: Thin, glowing borders on cards that simulate light catching the edge of glass.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover-Reveal**: Detailed stats reveal themselves on hover, keeping the initial view clean.
  - **Micro-Interactions**: Buttons glow and "press" down; charts animate on load.
  - **Glass Refraction**: Subtle background shifts behind glass panels when scrolling.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide in with a slight blur-to-focus effect.
  - **Data Visualization**: Charts grow from zero with a "digital load" effect.
  - **Transitions**: Smooth cross-fades with a slight zoom, emphasizing the "diving deeper" into data.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Rajdhani** (Bold/SemiBold) - A squared, futuristic sans-serif that screams "tech" and "stats".
  - **Body**: **Space Grotesk** or **Inter** (Regular/Medium) - Clean, highly readable for dense data, but with a slight tech edge.
  - **Data/Numbers**: **JetBrains Mono** - Monospaced font for all statistics to ensure perfect alignment and a "code/data" feel.

  **Design Movement**: **Neumorphic Sports Minimal**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Soft Realism**: Elements look like they are physically extruded from the surface.
  2. **Tactile Feel**: Buttons and cards invite clicking through realistic light and shadow.
  3. **Clean Canvas**: Minimal distractions, focusing purely on the players and the game.
  4. **Warmth & Energy**: A departure from cold tech, embracing the warmth of the sport.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Off-White/Light Grey (#e0e5ec)** base for the neumorphic effect.
  - **Cricket Red (#dc2626)** for primary actions, representing the leather ball.
  - **Turf Green (#16a34a)** for success and field elements.
  - **Shadows**: Soft blends of white and dark grey to create the 3D effect.
  - *Reasoning*: Creates a clean, approachable, and premium feel, distinct from the "dark mode" trend of gaming sites.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Soft Grid**: Content aligns to a gentle grid, but boundaries are defined by soft shadows rather than hard lines.
  - **Central Focus**: Key actions (like "Create Team") take center stage with prominent neumorphic extrusion.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Pressed/Extruded States**: Toggle switches and buttons physically look pressed in or popped out.
  - **Leather Texture**: Subtle leather grain texture on key elements (like the ball or headers).
  - **Circular Avatars**: Player photos in soft, extruded circles.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Visual "press" effect on clicks is crucial.
  - **Smooth Toggles**: Switching between views feels like sliding a physical switch.

  **Animation**:
  - **Soft Easing**: Animations are slow and smooth, mimicking physical weight.
  - **Shadow Morphing**: Shadows change direction or intensity based on interaction.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Montserrat** (ExtraBold) - Strong, geometric, and modern.
  - **Body**: **Nunito** (Regular) - Rounded and friendly, complementing the soft UI shapes.

  **Design Movement**: **Dynamic Motion Brutalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Energy**: Bold, high-contrast, and unapologetic.
  2. **Motion-First**: The interface feels like a live broadcast.
  3. **Typography as Image**: Large, oversized text acts as the primary visual element.
  4. **Grid Breaking**: Elements overlap and break the grid to create tension and excitement.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Stark Black (#000000)** and **White (#ffffff)** high contrast base.
  - **Neon Yellow (#facc15)** and **Hot Pink (#db2777)** for accents - high energy, T20 league vibes.
  - *Reasoning*: Captures the loud, fast-paced excitement of T20 cricket.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Split Screen**: Vertical or horizontal splits dividing imagery and data.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for updates and news.
  - **Overlapping Layers**: Images overlapping text, text overlapping images.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Halftone Patterns**: Retro-comic style dots for texture.
  - **Cut-out Imagery**: Player images with hard edges and no background.
  - **Thick Borders**: Heavy black outlines on buttons and cards.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap Scrolling**: Sections snap into place with impact.
  - **Hover Distortion**: Glitch effects or color shifts on hover.

  **Animation**:
  - **Kinetic Typography**: Text moves, scales, and rotates.
  - **Parallax**: Background and foreground move at different speeds.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Teko** or **Bebas Neue** (Uppercase) - Tall, condensed, and impactful.
  - **Body**: **Roboto Mono** - Technical and raw.
